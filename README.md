# Enhanced-Autonomous-Mushroom-Growing-System
Cultivating mushrooms has traditionally relied on constant human attention to maintain optimal environmental conditions for growth. The process demands a careful balance of humidity, temperature, CO2 level and soil moisture to ensure a healthy mushroom harvest. However, as mushroom cultivation scales up to meet growing demands, the need for increased human labor and time becomes a limiting factor. Recognizing this challenge, the development of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system emerges as a solution to achieve efficient and large-scale mushroom production with minimal human supervision. This prototype integrates sensors and automation to monitor and control the crucial factors affecting mushroom growth. By leveraging IoT technology, the system can adjust environmental parameters in real-time, ensuring an ideal habitat for mushrooms. This not only reduces the reliance on manual intervention but also enhances the precision and consistency of the cultivation process, ultimately leading to a more reliable and sustainable mushroom production.
